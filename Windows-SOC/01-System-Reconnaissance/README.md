# Windows System Reconnaissance

## Objective

Establish a basic security baseline of a Windows endpoint using
built-in Windows and PowerShell commands.

## Purpose

This lab focuses on the initial reconnaissance performed when
beginning an investigation of a Windows system.

The goal is to identify the system, the current user, local
accounts, and other basic information that can provide context
for further security investigations.

## Environment

- Operating System: Windows
- Shell: PowerShell
- Lab Type: SOC / Blue Team
- Focus: Endpoint Reconnaissance

## Investigation Questions

| Question | Tool / Command |
|---|---|
| Who am I logged in as? | `whoami` |
| What groups does my account belong to? | `whoami /groups` |
| What is the hostname? | `hostname` |
| What is the current date and time? | `Get-Date` |
| What operating system is running? | `systeminfo` |
| Which local user accounts exist? | `Get-LocalUser` |

## Methodology

The investigation follows a simple process:

**Question → Command → Output → Observation → Analysis**

Commands are not treated as isolated memorization exercises.
Each command is used to answer a specific investigative question.

## Findings

*To be completed after performing the investigation.*

## Lessons Learned

*To be completed after performing the investigation.*

## Evidence

Screenshots and relevant evidence from the investigation will
